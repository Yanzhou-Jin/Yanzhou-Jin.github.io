**Projects based on DJI drones** 
* Date: 06/2021
* Advisor: Professor Qingyi Gu
* Mainly responsible for designing real-time visual recognition solutions for robots (YOLO and mobilenet are deployed on the Jetson nano)
* Outcome: 2 awards

A areo robot has been designed for the *DJI RoboMaster 2021 University League Competition*, and it helpt the team won the second prize in the league competition (Class A).  
We deployed MobileNet on the Jetson-Nano embedded computer and realized real-time image recognition and basic vision guided navigation of a drone.
