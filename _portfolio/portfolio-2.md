title: "Miniature Quadruped Robotic Rat"
excerpt: "We designed a smaller sized robotic rat than our previous study, which can conqure multiple terrians. This robot can be remote controled by upper computer. The robot was designed with a compact and narrow body (wide: 4.88cm) and smaller weight (160g). The robot can adapt unstructred terrians, including sand, mud, grass, continuous ramp and narrow gap.<br/><img src='/images/little-rat.png' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto; width: 50%;'/>"

Legged robots are very promising for use in real world applications, but their operation in narrow spaces is still challenging. One solution for enhancing their environmental adapt ability is to design a small-sized biomimetic robot capable of performing multiple motions. By capturing a decent representation of an actual rat (rattus norvegicus), we proposed a smaller quadruped robotic rat from previous research (small-sized quadruped robotic rat (SQuRo)), which includes four limbs with 8 Degree of Freedom (DoF), and can be remote controled by upper computer. The robot was designed with a compact and narrow body (wide: 4.88cm) and smaller weight (160g). The robot can adapt unstructred terrians, including sand, mud, grass, continuous ramp and narrow gap.
