I was a student majored in Intellectual Mechatronical Systems at School of Mechatronical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, from 2019 to 2023, and was very fortunate to be adviced by Prof. Qing shi. I am currently a unconditional offer holder for the programme 'Applied Machine Learning (MSc)' of Imperial College London and will be enrolling in this September. 

I am passionate about robotics, including mechatronics design, machine learning, and computer vision. My expertise include Robotic Platform Design, trajectory analysis of moblie robots, embedded system programming and implementation of research tools. I have good team management skills and enjoy teamwork. Besides, I am good at project management and scheduling. Currently, Iâ€™m seeking opportunities that will allow me to broaden my experience. 

 **In the academic year 2024, I am seeking a PhD position in Robotics or other related field.**

Research Interest
------
My research interests lie in the integration of machine learning and robotics, particularly in vision algorithms and robot platform design. I have worked on the visual robotic system design and which enables robots to obtain basic visual information through integrated cameras. I have participated in various projects to gain a deeper understanding of robotic systems and have also interned at leading companies in robot design and manufacturing. I believe that the blending of AI and ML with robotics has broad implications for major sectors such as healthcare, computer rooms, and automobiles.

Events
