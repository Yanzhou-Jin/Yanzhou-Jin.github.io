Research Interest
------
My research interests lie in the integration of machine learning and robotics, particularly in vision algorithms and robot platform design. I have worked on the visual robotic system design and which enables robots to obtain basic visual information through integrated cameras. I have participated in various projects to gain a deeper understanding of robotic systems and have also interned at leading companies in robot design and manufacturing. I believe that the blending of AI and ML with robotics has broad implications for major sectors such as healthcare, computer room, and automobile.

**I am seeking a PhD position in Robotics or other related field that is available in next year(2024).**

Events
------
06-28-2023 Our article **"Design and Optimization of a Miniature Locust-Inspired Stable Jumping Robot"**, has just been published on IEEE Xplore and will be published on the Journal **IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters** in this August. Nice work to every one in our team.  

06-20-2023 I have received the Uncondition Offer for the program **Applied Machine Learning (MSc 1YFT)** at Imperial College London! I look foward to studying in London this September.
